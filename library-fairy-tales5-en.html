              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: Two horses</span><br>The story goes that in a family, there were two horses, a stallion and a mare. The mare was favored by her owner, and she leisurely roamed the fields all day, while the stallion was only let out to graze at night and had to work hard plowing during the day. One day, the mare advised the stallion: “Hey, brother, why do you have to work so hard? If I were you, I wouldn’t do it. If the owner dares to whip me, I’ll kick them back and show them what’s up.” Listening to the mare, the stallion showed his stubbornness the next day. Seeing this, the farmer tied the mare to the cart and forced it to work.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-lesson"><span>Lessons learned:</span>Through the short story for preschoolers about “Two Horses” helps us learn the lesson that each animal has its own role and responsibility, no two are the same. If you urge others to do wrong things, you can bring disaster upon yourself.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: The goose that laid the golden eggs</span><br>Once upon a time, there was a poor farmer couple who were lucky enough to own a goose that could lay golden eggs, one every day. However, greed gradually crept into their minds. Instead of appreciating and being grateful to the goose, they wanted to have more gold to quickly become rich. They imagined that if the goose could lay golden eggs, then its stomach must be made of pure gold. With a rash thought, they decided to cut open the goose's stomach to take all the gold at once. Full of joy and excitement, they cut open the goose, but the cruel truth hit their greed hard. The goose's stomach was completely normal, without any gold as they expected. The consequence of their greed was that they lost their precious goose that laid golden eggs - their only source of income. From then on, they had to live in poverty and regret their stupidity.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-lesson"><span>Lessons learned:</span>The preschool story “The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs” brings a meaningful lesson about greed. When people are controlled by greed, they will lose what they have and have to face bitter consequences.</div>
