              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: Saint Giong</span><br>Once upon a time, during the reign of King Hung, there was an old woman who lived alone, gentle and had never had a child. One morning, when she went to visit the field, she saw a huge footprint that had crushed the entire row of eggplants. She curiously tried to put her foot in it, but unexpectedly, when she got home, she became pregnant. When full term came, she gave birth to a chubby baby boy, named Gióng. Strangely, Gióng was three years old but still could not speak, laugh or turn over. Then, one day, the An invaders invaded, King Hung sent messengers everywhere to find talented people to save the country. Hearing the loudspeaker, Gióng's mother lamented and lulled her child to sleep, but unexpectedly, Gióng suddenly spoke for the first time, asking his mother to call the messenger in. In front of the messenger, Gióng asked the king to forge him an iron horse, an iron sword, iron armor and an iron helmet to go to battle. The villagers were amazed to hear the story and believed that this was a person from heaven who had come down to help the country. From then on, Gióng ate like never before: every time a pot of rice was served, he ate it all, no matter how much he ate, it was never enough. The more he ate, the faster he grew, as tall as a giant, no matter how many clothes he wore, they could not fit. When the iron horse and weapons were brought, Gióng stretched, suddenly transformed into a towering warrior, holding a sword in his hand, wearing an iron helmet, and jumped on the horse. The iron horse roared, breathed fire, and then rushed to the battlefield. Gióng brandished his sword like lightning, slashing the enemy without leaving a single one. When his sword broke, Gióng pulled up bamboo from the roadside as a weapon, continuing to crush the enemy. The general of the Ân enemy was destroyed, and the remaining army surrendered. After defeating the enemy, Gióng rode his horse to Sóc Sơn mountain, left behind his armor and iron helmet, then both he and his horse flew straight up to the sky, becoming immortal. King Hùng remembered his great merit, appointed Gióng as Phù Đổng Thiên Vương, built a temple to worship him, and passed it on forever.</div>
