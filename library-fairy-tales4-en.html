              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: The blind men and the elephant</span><br>Once upon a time, there were five blind fortune tellers. One day, they heard that someone was leading an elephant by, so they said to each other: “We have only heard about elephants, but we do not know what they look like. Why don’t we go and see together?” So all five of them came. When the elephant stood still, each of them touched a different place: One touched the trunk and said: “The elephant looks like a big leech.” One touched the tusk and said: “No, the elephant looks like a crowbar.” One touched the ear and argued: “You are both wrong, the elephant looks like a fan.” One touched the leg and said: “I think the elephant looks like a communal house pillar.” One touched the tail and said: “None of you are right, the elephant looks like a worn-out broom.” So the five argued fiercely, each thinking they were right, no one willing to listen to anyone. In the end, they left angrily, no one knowing what the elephant really looked like.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-lesson"><span>Lessons learned:</span>The story teaches us not to look at things one-sidedly, from only a small angle. Each person only sees a part of the truth, if we do not know how to listen and synthesize the opinions of others, we can easily make mistakes and argue uselessly.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: The Tortoise and the Hare</span><br>The story goes that there was a Tortoise and a Hare living together in a forest. The Hare was famous for his extraordinary speed, while the Tortoise moved very slowly. One day, the Hare and the Tortoise argued about who was faster. The arrogant Hare believed that he would easily win the Tortoise in a race. The Tortoise knew that he was slower but still wanted to try. The race began. The Hare shot like an arrow, leaving the Tortoise far behind. Seeing the Tortoise moving slowly, the Hare was overconfident and decided to rest under the shade of a tree. The Hare fell asleep while the Tortoise continued to crawl step by step. When the Hare woke up, he was startled to realize that the Tortoise was nearing the finish line. The Hare tried his best to run but it was too late. The Tortoise had reached the finish line first and became the winner.</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-lesson"><span>Lessons learned:</span>Although we start with many advantages, we should not be arrogant and subjective. The above preschool story also gives us a positive perspective, encouraging everyone to always try, effort will bring everyone to success.</div>
