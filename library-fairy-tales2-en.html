              <div class="fairy-content-text-fairy"> <span>Story: Paying back with gold</span><br>Once upon a time, in a small village, there were two brothers who depended on each other since their parents died early. Their parents left them a small fortune, enough for the two brothers to live peacefully. However, their personalities were very different: the older brother was lazy and playful, all the hard work fell on the shoulders of the gentle and diligent younger brother. Despite the hardship, the younger brother never complained. When he grew up, the older brother wanted to get married so he demanded to divide the family property. Because of greed and cunning, he found a way to take over all the house, cattle and property, leaving his younger brother only a small, dilapidated hut and a garden with a star fruit tree. Ignoring his younger brother's poverty, the older brother lived happily with most of the property. Then, one year, the star fruit tree in the younger brother's garden suddenly bore golden fruit, with a sweet fragrance. The younger brother was overjoyed, hoping to sell the star fruit for some rice. But one day, a huge bird flew from somewhere and landed and ate all the ripe star fruit. The younger brother sadly ran out and lamented: - Oh bird, I only have this star fruit tree to live on. If you eat it all, what will I have to exchange for rice? Strangely, the giant bird turned back and said: - Eat one fruit, pay one gold bar. Make a three-span bag and carry it with you. At first, the younger brother was surprised, but then he followed the bird's words and sewed a bag exactly three spans long. Sure enough, the next day the bird returned, carried his younger brother and flew far away, over mountains and seas, and then to an island full of treasures. The younger brother only took enough to fill the bag and asked to return. Thanks to that, from then on he lived properly, no longer suffering. The older brother heard the story and became greedy, so he persuaded his younger brother to exchange his property and take back the star fruit tree. Not long after, the divine bird came again. The older brother also imitated sewing a bag, but not three spans long but nine spans long. When he got to the island, he collected all the gold and silver, stuffed them into his pockets, and even carried them on his person. On the way back, the bird flew heavily and repeatedly told the man to throw away some of the gold, but the man did not listen. Finally, the bird lost its strength and tilted its wings, and the man and the bag of gold fell into the sea, lost forever.</div>
