One day, he got a new shirt, so he put it on and stood at the door, waiting for someone to pass by and compliment him. He stood there from morning to evening without seeing anyone ask him anything, so he was very angry. While he was angry, he suddenly saw a man who also liked to show off, so he hurriedly ran up and asked loudly:<br>– Did you see my wedding pig run by here?<br>The other guy immediately held out his shirt and said:– Since I wore this new shirt, I haven't seen any pigs run past here!</div>
              <div class="fairy-content-text-lesson"><span>Story: Hanging the sign</span><br>At a fish shop, there was a sign with big letters: "Fresh fish sold here".<br>As soon as the sign was hung up, a passerby saw it and said with a smile:<br>– Has this house always sold rotten fish that now it has to put up a sign saying “sells fresh fish”?<br>The shop owner heard that and immediately removed the word "fresh".<br>The next day, another person came to buy fish, also looked up at the sea, smiled and said:<br>– People don't go to the flower shop to buy fish, why do they have to say "here"?<br>The shop owner heard and immediately removed the two words "here".<br>A few days later, another person came to buy fish, also looked up at the sea, smiled and said:<br>– If you don't sell fish here, why do you put the fish out to show off that it says "for sale"?<br>The shop owner heard this and immediately removed the two words “for sale”. So the only word left on the sign was “fish”. He thought to himself that from now on no one would find fault with it[3].<br>A few days later, the neighbor came over, looked up at the sea and said:<br>– Oh my, I smelled a fishy smell before even reaching the end of the street. When I got closer to the house, I saw it was full of fish. Everyone knew that fish was for sale, so why did they have to put up a sign?<br>So the restaurant took down the sign.</div>
