              <div class="spell-content-paragraph">The first day of school has come. Early in the morning, my mother just called me and I jumped up, completely different from every other day. In a flash, I had finished preparing everything. My father looked at me in surprise, and my mother smiled. I hurriedly said: "I want to go to class first." I excitedly imagined myself arriving first, loudly greeting the students who arrived later. But as soon as I reached the school gate, I saw my classmates chatting and laughing in the yard. It turned out that I was not the only one who wanted to arrive first. I said goodbye to my mother and rushed in with my friends. We competed to tell stories about our summer days. Right next to us, some first graders were shyly holding their parents' hands, just like me last year. In front of them, I felt like I had grown up. I was already a second grader.</div>

              <div class="spell-content-paragraph">The teacher said, “We need to learn how to communicate confidently. So today we will practice speaking in front of the class about anything we like.”<br>Quang was invited to speak first. He was embarrassed and blushed. Quang felt that speaking to his friend next to him was easy, but speaking in front of the whole class was so difficult. The teacher said: “What did you do when you woke up this morning? Try to remember.”<br>Quang hesitated, scratching his head as he spoke: "I...".<br>The teacher reminded: "And then what?"<br>Quang scratched his head again: "Ah... uh... I woke up." And he continued: "Then... uh...".<br>The teacher smiled and patiently listened to Quang. He said: "That's enough!"<br>But Quang still hadn't returned to his seat. Suddenly, he said loudly: "And then... uh... ah..." Quang took a deep breath and continued: "Mom... uh... said: Go brush your teeth. So I brushed my teeth." The teacher clapped his hands. The whole class clapped along. Finally, Quang said confidently: "Then Dad took me to school."<br>The teacher clapped his hands. The students clapped along. Quang clapped too. The whole class was filled with applause.</div>
